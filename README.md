# LightWave

Basic Windows MDI application for audio editing of 8 and 16b, mono, audio PCM encoded .wav files. Runs on Windows 32b or 64b OS. 

Was originally built in Delphi2 for a student project in 1996, updated to work with Delphi 7.

The functionality consits of: record at custom frequencies mono 8 or 16 bit, play, new, open, save, save as, save selection as, cut, copy, paste with one level of undo, spectogram, zoom in, out and scroll.

Was used to review and prepare audio recordings for speech and speaker recognition projects pre Y2K.

A usefull tool for those in the field. 32 bit executable included.

Enjoy!
